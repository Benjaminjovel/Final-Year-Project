Project Title: Automatic Logo Detection and Recognition in Google Street View

Abstract: 
      Logo detection is a useful tool in marketing applications such as verification of product placement, online brand management, contextual ad placement or consumer analysis. Analyzing the presence of brands and logos in social media, television or printed media can be a tedious task if done manually.

New advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, specifically in deep learning, provide new methods to automatically identify objects within an image. These methods have provided state of the art results when applied to the task of logo detection and recognition. Deep learning methods use networks that learn from a large amount of labeled (ground truth) data instead of using complex engineered hand- crafted visual features. Therefore, obtaining large amounts of data/label pairs is important to obtain good results.
